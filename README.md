# WebProjectM1

To make it work : type "npm install" in the console after opening the folder in VS Code 
then "npm start" to launch the website on "http://localhost:3000

This project is not finished. 
To summarize, I spent too much time on the backend part, trying to link the front and back without working on the front end. 

But here is what is finished : 

On the backend part :

- register and login in database 
- add artist in database ('api/addArtist')
- get the lists of all artists 
- delete artist
- add album for an artist 
- get all the albums from an artist 
- delete a specific album 

On the front-end part :

- basic structure of the website 
- display of the artists present in the database 
- login/register
- basic navigation between pages

I spent too much time trying to display the albums of a specific artist (call to backend)
It is implemented, but it doesn't work. 

The goal was to implement a cart and buttons next to the albums to add them to the cart.
